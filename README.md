#Acheron Binary Distributions

* Currently just the GUI is packaged here
* Packaged this way because source GUI has electron as a dependancy. (need to run electron . from the gui/ directory if not prebuilt)
* Binary dists are VERY large right now because I'm compiling dev dependencies right in.
* Will be much smaller when I fix up the node_modules (not a problem in the src repo)
* Just Windows here for now.
